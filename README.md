# nodered-jkbms-over-rs485
This is a failed and not finished project. Maybe some code snippets could still be useful.

All 6 JK-BMS were connected via RS485 in parallel.
The problem is, that all 6 JK-BMS respond when you request data from a single BMS.

I will switch to this approach: https://github.com/Uksa007/esphome-jk-bms-can
